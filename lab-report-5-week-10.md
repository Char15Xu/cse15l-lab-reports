## Choose Test Cases
For this lab, the two tests I choose are 14 and 143 in the test-files directory.
I found the different results using vimdiff command in lab 9.

## Links
Here are the links for the two tests:
Test 14: [Link](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/14.md)
Test 143: [Link](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/143.md)

---

## Expected Output
For both tests, neither of my result was correct. For test 142, the expected output should be [], which has nothing inside. Also, test 143 should have [] with nothing inside since neither of these test cases has an actual link. The markdown-parse provided by the TA and my own markdown-parse both have incorrect output for test 142, but the TA does have the correct out put for test 143. To check, we can use VSCode preview.
For test 14, we get [!Image](lab5-14.png)
For test 143, we get [!Image](lab5-143.png)

## Actual Output
The expected output for both of these files is just no link at all. 
The actual output, however, is [!Image](lab5-actual1.png)

## Discussion
For test 14,
For test 143,
