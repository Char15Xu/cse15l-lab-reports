# Lab Report 2 Week 4
April 24th, 2022. Tianyang Xu. 

This lab report includes three code changes that address following symptoms:
- Infinite loop caused by incorrect index (failtest1)
- Infinite loop caused by false recognition of parenthesis (failtest2)
- Falsely read image as a link (failtest3)

All of the test and code changes are stored in my repository. 
For each code change, I will include 
1. a screenshot of code change diff from Github
2. link to the failed test file
3. output on the command line for the failed test
4. Brief explaination for the relation among symptom, bug, and failure-inducing input.
